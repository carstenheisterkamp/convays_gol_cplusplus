# CONVAY'S GAME OF LIFE

A plain C++ implementation of Convays Game of Life.

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, a cellular automaton created by John Conway in 1970. It simulates the evolution of a population of cells on a grid based on simple rules applied to each cell's neighbors. The initial configuration of cells determines the entire future evolution of the system.
